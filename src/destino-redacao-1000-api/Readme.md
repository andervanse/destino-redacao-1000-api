# ASP.NET Core Web API Serverless Application

This project shows how to run an ASP.NET Core Web API project as an AWS Lambda exposed through Amazon API Gateway. The NuGet package [Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer) contains a Lambda function that is used to translate requests from API Gateway into the ASP.NET Core framework and then the responses from ASP.NET Core back to API Gateway.

The project starts with two Web API controllers. The first is the example ValuesController that is created by default for new ASP.NET Core Web API projects. The second is S3ProxyController which uses the AWS SDK for .NET to proxy requests for an Amazon S3 bucket.


### Project Files ###

* serverless.template - an AWS CloudFormation Serverless Application Model template file for declaring your Serverless functions and other AWS resources
* aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json - default argument settings for use with Visual Studio and command line deployment tools for AWS
* LambdaEntryPoint.cs - class that derives from **Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayProxyFunction**. The code in 
this file bootstraps the ASP.NET Core hosting framework. The Lambda function is defined in the base class.
Change the base class to **Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.ApplicationLoadBalancerFunction** when using an 
Application Load Balancer.
* LocalEntryPoint.cs - for local development this contains the executable Main function which bootstraps the ASP.NET Core hosting framework with Kestrel, as for typical ASP.NET Core applications.
* Startup.cs - usual ASP.NET Core Startup class used to configure the services ASP.NET Core will use.
* web.config - used for local development.
* Controllers\S3ProxyController - Web API controller for proxying an S3 bucket
* Controllers\ValuesController - example Web API controller

You may also have a test project depending on the options selected.

## Here are some steps to follow to get started from the command line:

Once you have edited your template and code you can deploy your application using the [Amazon.Lambda.Tools Global Tool](https://github.com/aws/aws-extensions-for-dotnet-cli#aws-lambda-amazonlambdatools) from the command line.

Install Amazon.Lambda.Tools Global Tools if not already installed.
```
    dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

If already installed check if new version is available.
```
    dotnet tool update -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

Execute unit tests
```
    cd "destino-redacao-1000-api/test/destino-redacao-1000-api.Tests"
    dotnet test
```

Deploy application
```
    cd "destino-redacao-1000-api/src/destino-redacao-1000-api"
    dotnet lambda deploy-serverless
```

Update Lambda Function
```
  dotnet lambda deploy-function arn:aws:lambda:sa-east-1:469615216345:function:destino-redacao-1000-AspNetCoreFunction-19MPLDO4VYYXU â€“-function-role arn:aws:iam::469615216345:role/destino-redacao-1000-AspNetCoreFunctionRole-1L44UU3QBSOB8
